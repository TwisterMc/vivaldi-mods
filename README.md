# vivaldi-mods

This is a few of my mods (js and css) in the Vivaldi Browser. 

I'll try to document a few of them here in the readme. 

## edge_style_vertical_tabs.css

I have spent the last few hours working on a similar design (with almost pixel perfect recreation, and some goodies and cleanup) creating a sidebar tabs/vertical tab layout similar to what is being tested in the latest Microsoft Edge.

Personally, I absolutely love their design, the way they work, and everything about them. I have been trading Vivaldi/Edge on and off because of it. But, because they are an alpha only feature they disappeared recently. I spent the day redesigning them from visual only and it took about four or five hours.

I also made sure that they would work with any themes and look visually similar no matter your color preferences, and I made sure that everything that needs to be rounded, is rounded according to your specifications.

I also went ahead and tested horizontal menus and the different application icons to make sure they all line up properly.
